HTML::Template::Pro::Extension README File
=====================================

Introduction
------------
  This module extends HTML::Template::Pro to easily support methods and tags not 
implemented in parent module. Piece of code needed to add new tags syntax and 
new functionality are called plugins. 

  All plugins can be dynamically loaded for supporing needed syntax and 
functionality. All dynamic plugins live in the HTML::Template::Extension 
namespace and you can built your own extension to support you prefered tags and 
functionality.

  A plugin named DO_NOTHING is present in this package and can be use like a 
skeleton to built your own plugin. DO_NOTHING, as name says, add nothing to 
standard HTML::Template::Extension but there are other plugins just available:

- HTML::Template::Extension::DOC: to support comment text

- HTML::Template::Extension::SLASH_VAR: to support <TMPL_VAR></TMPL_VAR> syntax

- HTML::Template::Extension::CSTART: to select what parts of your template must 
be returned by "output" and "html" method

- HTML::Template::Extension::HEAD_BODY: that don't add tag syntax but some 
method for easily working with html files

- HTML::Template::Extension::TAG_ATTRIBUTE_NORMALIZER to remove unknown 
HTML::Template attribute to tags.

- HTML::Template::Extension::DO_NOTHING: that do nothing :-)
