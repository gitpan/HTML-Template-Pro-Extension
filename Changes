Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Template::Pro::Extension.

0.05 (2005-09-14)
=================
- If you try to initialize H::T::P::Extention with some parameters that should
  be routed to H::T::Pro, it doesn't work because H::T::P::Extension 
	inizialize H::T::Pro with internal parameters. Now you can pass 
	initializing parameters (like functions as an example) to H::T::P::Extension
	that routed them to H::T::Pro.

0.04 (2005-08-21)
=================
- A little optimization in calling H::T::P->param method.

0.03 (2005-08-18)
=================
- Removed a bug.

0.02 (2005-08-17)
=================
- Minor changes

0.01 (2005-08-16)
=================
- First release derived from HTML::Template::Extension
