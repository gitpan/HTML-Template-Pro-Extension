0.08 (2005-11-02)
=================
- Now, when calling filters, the object is passed to filter as second parameter.
- Removed a bug in the HEAD_BODY.pm module that cannot parse headers sometimes.

0.07 (2005-09-20)

0.05 (2005-09-14)

- If you try to initialize H::T::P::Extention with some parameters that should

	initializing parameters (like functions as an example) to H::T::P::Extension
	that routed them to H::T::Pro.
